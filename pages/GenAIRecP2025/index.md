# Overview
Personalization is key in understanding user behavior and has been a main focus in the fields of knowledge discovery and information retrieval. Building personalized recommender systems is especially important now due to the vast amount of user-generated textual content, which offers deep insights into user preferences. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted research areas, mainly in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Discovery, giving these models the ability to handle complex tasks and learn context.

However, the use of generative models and user-generated text for personalized systems and recommendation is relatively new and has shown some promising results. This workshop is designed to bridge the research gap in these fields and explore personalized applications and recommender systems. We aim to fully leverage generative models to develop AI systems that are not only accurate but also focused on meeting individual user needs. Building upon the momentum of previous successful forums, this workshop seeks to engage a diverse audience from academia and industry, fostering a dialogue that incorporates fresh insights from key stakeholders in the field. 

# Call for papers
We will welcome papers that leverage generative models with a goal of recommendation and personalization on several topics including but not limited to those mentioned in [CFP](https://genai-personalization.github.io/GenAIRecP2025/call-for-papers). Papers can be submitted at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2025/Workshop/GenAIRecP).
