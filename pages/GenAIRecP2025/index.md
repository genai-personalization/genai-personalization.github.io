        **From Sight to Insight: Visual Memory for Smarter Assistants**

      abstract: >
         Imagine a personal assistant that, with user permission, persistently remembers moments from daily life—answering questions like “When and where did I see this lady?” or offering personalized suggestions like “You might enjoy The Little Prince—it relates to the statue you liked in Lyon.” Realizing this vision requires overcoming major challenges: capturing visual memories under hardware constraints (e.g., memory, battery, thermal limits, bandwidth), extracting meaningful personalization signals from noisy, task-agnostic visual histories, and supporting real-time question answering and recommendations under tight latency requirements. 
         In this talk, we present our early work toward this goal. Pensieve, our memory-based QA system, improves accuracy by 11% over state-of-the-art multimodal RAG baselines. VisualLens infers user interests from casual photos, outperforming leading recommendation systems by 5–10%. We also share initial results on efficient, event-triggered memory capture and compression. Our work points to a broad landscape of research opportunities in building richer, more context-aware personal assistants capable of learning from and reasoning over users’ visual experiences.

        **Harnessing Generative AI for Efficient Multimodal Recommender Systems and Privacy-preserving Personalized Image Generation**

      abstract: >
         Generative AI is reshaping research and industry across domains, from recommender systems and computer vision to healthcare and education, by enabling powerful new models like large language models (LLM), diffusion networks, and multimodal architectures. These advances also introduce critical challenges in efficiency, modality integration, privacy, and system robustness. This talk shares two strands of our recent work that harness generative AI for recommender systems and personalized image generation. The first strand introduces PRIME, a preference-optimized retrieval and ranking framework for efficient multimodal recommendation. PRIME pioneers the use of LLM-based ranking feedback to iteratively  refine the retriever via online preference optimization. The second strand examines the Anti- Tamper Perturbation (ATP) scheme for privacy-aware, personalized image generation: a  unified approach that embeds protection and authorization perturbations to safeguard individual images against forgery attacks. The talk concludes with several directions for future research in harnessing generative AI for personalized and trustworthy systems.

# Overview
Personalization is key in understanding user behavior and has been a main focus in the fields of knowledge discovery and information retrieval. Building personalized recommender systems is especially important now due to the vast amount of user-generated textual content, which offers deep insights into user preferences. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted research areas, mainly in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Discovery, giving these models the ability to handle complex tasks and learn context.

However, the use of generative models and user-generated text for personalized systems and recommendation is relatively new and has shown some promising results. This workshop is designed to bridge the research gap in these fields and explore personalized applications and recommender systems. We aim to fully leverage generative models to develop AI systems that are not only accurate but also focused on meeting individual user needs. Building upon the momentum of previous successful forums, this workshop seeks to engage a diverse audience from academia and industry, fostering a dialogue that incorporates fresh insights from key stakeholders in the field. 

# Call for papers
We will welcome papers that leverage generative models with a goal of recommendation and personalization on several topics including but not limited to those mentioned in [CFP](https://genai-personalization.github.io/GenAIRecP2025/call-for-papers). Papers can be submitted at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2025/Workshop/GenAIRecP).
