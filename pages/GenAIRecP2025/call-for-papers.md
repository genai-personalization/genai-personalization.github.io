We will welcome papers that leverage generative models with a goal of recommendation and personalization on several topics including but not limited to:
- Generative AI for multimodal and sequential modeling in recommender systems
- Personalized generative retrieval and recommendation models
- Instruction-tuned recommender systems
- LLM-driven personalized dialogue systems
- Personalized text and image generation
- Privacy in personalized generative AI systems
- Fairness, explainability, and transparency in LLM-driven personalized and recommender systems
- Efficiency and scalability of LLM-driven personalization and recommendation systems
- Evaluation of LLM-driven personalization and recommendation systems


### Important dates

- Paper submission deadline: ~~May 8th, 2025~~ May 15th, 2025
- Paper acceptance notification: June 8th, 2025
- Workshop: August 6th, 2025


### Submission Instructions:
- Authors should submit papers with up to 5 pages excluding references and supplementary materials via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2025/Workshop/GenAIRecP) .
- Submissions should be formatted using the official KDD 2025 template which can be found at [https://kdd2025.kdd.org/research-track-call-for-papers/](https://kdd2025.kdd.org/research-track-call-for-papers/).
- Submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review
- Dual submission policy: This workshop welcomes ongoing and unpublished work but will also accept papers that are under review or have recently been accepted at other venues.

### FAQ
- Q: Can I submit work that is currently under review elsewhere?
  - A: Yes.
- Q: Will the workshop papers be included in the KDD'25 proceeding?
  - A: No, so submitting to the workshop conforms to the dual submission policy.
- Q: I'm from industry, how should I maintain anonymity?
  - A: The author's information should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. However, it's acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions.
- Q: Can previously published papers be submitted to the workshop?
  - A: Yes, though we only encourage very recent and relevant papers.
