We invite submissions to the Third Workshop on Generative AI for Recommender Systems and Personalization (GenAIRecP 2026), to be held in conjunction with [WSDM 2026](https://wsdm-conference.org/2026/) in Boise, Idaho, USA.

We welcome papers that leverage generative models with a goal of recommendation and personalization on topics including but not limited to:
- Generative AI for multimodal and sequential modeling in recommender systems
- Personalized generative retrieval and recommendation models
- Instruction-tuned recommender systems
- LLM-driven personalized dialogue systems
- Personalized text and image generation
- Privacy in personalized generative AI systems
- Fairness, explainability, and transparency in LLM-driven personalized and recommender systems
- Efficiency and scalability of LLM-driven personalization and recommendation systems
- Evaluation of LLM-driven personalization and recommendation systems

### Important dates
- Paper submission deadline: November 13, 2025
- Paper acceptance notification: December 18, 2025
- Workshop: February 26, 2026

### Submission Instructions:
- Authors should submit papers with up to 5 pages excluding references and supplementary materials (submission link TBD).
- Submissions should follow WSDM formatting guidelines (link TBD).
- Submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.
- Dual submission policy: This workshop welcomes ongoing and unpublished work but will also accept papers that are under review or have recently been accepted at other venues.

### FAQ
- Q: Can I submit work that is currently under review elsewhere?
  - A: Yes.
- Q: Will the workshop papers be included in the conference proceedings?
  - A: No, the workshop proceedings policy will be clarified later, but authors may submit elsewhere. Organizers will be invited to submit a camera-ready summary to WSDM proceedings (organizer-facing).
- Q: I'm from industry, how should I maintain anonymity?
  - A: The author's information should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. However, it's acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions.
- Q: Can previously published papers be submitted to the workshop?
  - A: Yes, though we only encourage very recent and relevant papers.
